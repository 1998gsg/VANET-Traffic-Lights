# VANET-Traffic-Lights

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) is a famous and special kind of wireless
mobile ad hoc network. It is ad-hoc network where each network node acts an independent and self-organized network. In VANET various routing protocols have
been proposed and used and they are of high importance for desirable VANET applications. In this project we plan to propose an improved routing algorithm to
facilitate faster communication between clusters. The simulation results of position
based routing protocols are discussed in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput metrics
